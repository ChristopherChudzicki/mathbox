# Jupyter notebook embedding example

This folder contains examples of embedding interactive MathBox plots 
into [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks and feeding them data
from the Python backend.

[View the notebook online using NBViewer service]()

To be able to run the notebook code locally you need to have Jupyter
[installed](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

Once you have it, run `jupyter notebook` command in this directory,
and click on "mathbox.ipynb" file in the appeared browser window.
